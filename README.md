# ObjectOrientedProjects
Projects for my Object Oriented Programming class

Assignment one consisted of cleaning up another's code and making it more readable and easier to follow and refactor in the future.

Assignment two uses object-oriented programming to create multiple versions of the card game War, this is done with an interface to allow
for easy refactoring in the future should more versions of the game need to be added.

Assignment three mimics a drawing application with only text input and utilizes a chain of responsibility pattern for handling input,
a command pattern for executing and undoing the inputted actions, and a memento patter for storing previous information and commands to assist
in the process of undoing previous actions.
